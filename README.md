# Portfolio

## Description
This project was made to better my understanding of CSS and more of how to go about styling webpages. This is a portfolio used to showcase to employers and as a good start of a portfolio webpage built from scratch. It helped me deepen my understanding of CSS and what different elements and selectors do while also knowing which things to style and edit to make the webpage look better.

## Usage

This project is used a webpage for showcasing your work to employers and also a good basic webpage to build off and edit or play with to understand more advanced CSS.
